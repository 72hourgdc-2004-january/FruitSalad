    Other information:
    ------------------
    Fruit Salad was programmed in C++ and uses the D3DXSprite library that comes with DirectX for its graphics, and DirectSound for sound output.  All graphics editing was done in Paint Shop Pro.  All sound recording/editing was done through Wave Flow.  All sound effects were recorded by me using various things I had around the house (blowing bubbles in water, knocking on the wood desk, bopping noises with mouth, etc.)  Nothing was created before the contest began.  Everything was done within the 72-hour period.
